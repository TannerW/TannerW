:mortar_board: By education - I am a Computational Science Engineer with emphasis and published works in computational linear algebra and its applications

:office: By career - I am currently an Algorithm Research Engineer focusing on the research and development of numerical algorithms for applications in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing

:exclamation: Yet, By passion - I am just a guy who enjoys spending my day-to-day tackling modern novel problems, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and if it's welcomed by others, encouraging and teaching those around me to share in my fascination with computing

## My go-to's
Languages: C++, Matlab, Python

Libraries/Platforms/APIs: CUDA, OpenMP/MPI, GSL, IntelMKL, Tensorflow, PyTorch

## What's up with Tanner

- ðŸ”­ Outside of work, Iâ€™m currently working on **some passion projects that are centered around Stochastic Programming, Dynamized Graph Traversal, and Dynamized Graph Analytics** 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **state-of-the-art methods for handling the storing and traversal of dynamic, time-dependent graphs on heterogeneous computing target platforms**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **my dog Mini!** (But get ready for an earful of me telling you about how awesome she is... this may include, but is not limited to, me sending you links to photo albums to prove her cuteness)
